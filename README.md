# Indigoboard
A taggable "booru-style" imageboard written in Node.js

Written in collaboration with @MikeColeCo and @TheJumono

# Requirements
NodeJS
NPM
MongoDB

# To setup

Git clone this repository into a folder.
Run "npm install" inside that folder.
Create a folder named "mongo" inside "web/database".
Run "./mongo.sh" to start up the mongo server.
Connect to the database at least once and do "use board" to generate the database.
(Note, you can disconnect afterwards, the code will take care of the rest)
